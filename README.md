# Stock Data Aggregator & Visualizer

This is a self-hosted application designed to aggregate stock data from multiple sources, including yfinance, and store it locally in an SQLite3 database. The backend is powered by FastAPI, while the frontend is built with React, allowing users to interact with stock data, explore S&P 500 stocks, visualize key indicators using line and waterfall charts, and customize stock grids dynamically.
