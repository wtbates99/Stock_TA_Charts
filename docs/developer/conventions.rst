Coding Conventions
===================

Introduction
============
This document outlines the coding conventions and standards for our Python projects, focusing on data analysis and machine learning components. Adhering to these guidelines ensures code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

Code Style
==========
We adhere to the PEP 8 style guide with the following specific conventions:

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.
- **Line Length:** Maximum of 79 characters.
- **Imports:**
  - Standard library imports should be placed before third-party imports.
  - Use absolute imports when possible.
  - Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    1. Standard library imports.
    2. Related third-party imports.
    3. Local application/library specific imports.

Documentation
=============
- **Docstrings:** Follow the NumPy style for docstrings to ensure compatibility with documentation generation tools like Sphinx.
  - Provide a brief description of the function/method.
  - List each parameter and explain its purpose.
  - Provide an example if applicable.

Reusability
-----------
- Encourage the reuse of code across multiple scripts or modules. Identify common functions and move them to a utility module or package.

Data Handling and Error Management
----------------------------------
- Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions from external data sources and during data processing.
- Standardize data preprocessing steps and document them to ensure that data inputs are consistently handled across different scripts.

Testing
=======
- **Unit Tests:** Each module should have corresponding unit tests.
  - Use the `unittest` framework.
  - Name test files with the prefix `test_` followed by the module name.

Machine Learning Model Implementation
-------------------------------------
- Clearly document the purpose and parameters of machine learning models, including any hyperparameters and their selection process.
- Ensure all machine learning models are accompanied by a thorough explanation of the model's architecture and training process.

Version Control
===============
- **Commit Messages:** Write meaningful commit messages with a brief description of changes in the imperative mood.
- **Branches:** Use feature branches for development and merge them into the main branch upon completion.

Security
========
- **Code Security:** Regularly scan code for vulnerabilities.
  - Use tools like Bandit to analyze code for security issues.

Performance
===========
- **Optimizations:** Focus on readability first and optimize code only when necessary based on profiling data.
